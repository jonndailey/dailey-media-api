- Progress tracking and webhooks
- Basic transcoding operations

## API Design
\`\`\`javascript
// Start video processing
const job = await api.processVideo(videoId, {
  outputs: [
    { format: 'mp4', codec: 'h264', quality: 'high' },
    { format: 'webm', codec: 'vp9', quality: 'medium' }
  ],
  webhookUrl: 'https://app.example.com/video-complete'
})

// Check processing status
const status = await api.getProcessingStatus(job.id)
\`\`\`

## Implementation Approach
- [ ] Create FFmpeg Docker container
- [ ] Implement job queue with Redis
- [ ] Add processing status endpoints
- [ ] Create webhook notification system
- [ ] Add video metadata extraction
